### Overview ###

The Open Data Portal of the Municipality of Natal is a tool whose main objective is to make available to the whole community data and public information of the city and municipal organs, enabling the monitoring of its operation and the achievement of access to information (regulated by Law Of Access to Public Information - Law 12,527 / 2011).

The data available in the Portal can be accessed by the entire population, as well as used for the development of applications and actions carried out by the City Hall itself and by other public or private agencies.

Specifically for this project, the data related to health units and municipal schools was used to map the incidences
of its units in Natal city.

This project´s goals are:

- Generate a Histogram/bar figure reporting the number of "municipal schools" and "health units";
- Generate a Geocoder figure about those units;
- Generate a heatmap figure considering the number of employees in each unit.

### Final considerations ###

The experience of work with Python, geocoder, foliu and open data showed to me the potential of data analysis.
Retrieving a large amount of data and transforming it into geocoder figures and other kind of maps, can provide
such a rich resource of insights that could be transformed into different type of businesses.
